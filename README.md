## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+ (needed for Ukrainian and Russian TTS)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GryphonEDM/gryphons-ukrainian-russian-learning-app.git
cd gryphons-ukrainian-russian-learning-app
npm install
```

### 2. Run the web app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. The app is fully functional without the TTS server - you just won't hear Ukrainian/Russian pronunciation. English TTS works out of the box (see below).

### 3. (Optional) Enable Ukrainian & Russian text-to-speech

The TTS server runs both Ukrainian and Russian speech synthesis on a single Flask server (port 3002). English TTS is handled separately by the browser and requires no setup.

#### Install Python dependencies

```bash
# Install the Ukrainian TTS library
cd tts-repo
pip install -e .
cd ..

# Install server and model dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors torch
```

> **Note:** `torch` (PyTorch) is required by both the Ukrainian and Russian TTS models. If you run into issues with `espnet` (used by Ukrainian TTS), install it explicitly: `pip install espnet`

#### Start the TTS server

```bash
python tts-server.py
```

On first run, models are downloaded automatically:
- **Ukrainian model** (~425 MB) - ESPnet model from [robinhad/ukrainian-tts](https://github.com/robinhad/ukrainian-tts) releases, saved to `tts-model/`
- **Russian model** (~65 MB) - Silero v5 model from [silero-models](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models), saved to `tts-model-ru/`

After the initial download, TTS works fully offline. You should see:

```
[OK] Ukrainian TTS loaded successfully!
[OK] Ukrainian TTS model loaded!
[OK] Russian TTS model loaded! (speaker: aidar)
[SPEAKER] TTS Server (Ukrainian + Russian)
   Starting on http://localhost:3002
```

### Windows one-click start

Double-click `start.bat` to automatically install all dependencies and start both the web app and TTS server.

### Mac/Linux one-click start

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Text-to-Speech Details

This app uses three different TTS engines, one for each language:

| | English | Ukrainian | Russian |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Technology** | Browser Web Speech API | ESPnet (robinhad/ukrainian-tts) | Silero v5 |
| **Server required?** | No (runs in browser) | Yes (`tts-server.py`) | Yes (`tts-server.py`) |
| **Model download** | None | ~425 MB (auto on first run) | ~65 MB (auto on first run) |
| **Model location** | N/A | `tts-model/` | `tts-model-ru/` |
| **Voice** | OS default | Oleksa (male) | Aidar (male) |
| **Works offline?** | Yes | Yes (after first download) | Yes (after first download) |
| **Cache** | None | `tts-cache/` | `tts-cache-ru/` |

### English TTS

English pronunciation (used in flashcard mode for English translations) uses the browser's built-in [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis). No setup required - it works automatically in any modern browser using your OS's installed voices.

### Ukrainian TTS

Uses the [ukrainian-tts](https://github.com/robinhad/ukrainian-tts) library by robinhad, which is an ESPnet-based model. The library source is included in the `tts-repo/` directory. The model files (~425 MB) are downloaded from GitHub releases on first run and cached in `tts-model/`. Five voices are available (Oleksa, Tetiana, Dmytro, Mykyta, Lada) - the server uses Oleksa by default.

### Russian TTS

Uses [Silero Models v5](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) for Russian speech synthesis. The model (~65 MB) is downloaded automatically on first run from `https://models.silero.ai` and saved to `tts-model-ru/v5_ru.pt`. The server uses the "aidar" voice at 48kHz sample rate.

## How to play

1. **Set up your keyboard** - Add Ukrainian or Russian as an input language in your OS settings (click the Keyboard Setup Guide in the app for instructions)
2. **Switch your keyboard** - Use `Win+Space` (Windows), `Ctrl+Space` (Mac), or `Super+Space` (Linux) to switch to the target language
3. **Start typing** - Pick a lesson and type the letters/words shown. The virtual keyboard highlights which key to press
4. **Explore other modes** - Try flashcards, grammar lessons, reading practice, and more from the main menu

## Troubleshooting

**App works but no Ukrainian/Russian sound?**
- Make sure TTS is enabled in Settings (bottom of main menu)
- Check that the TTS server is running (`python tts-server.py`)
- The server should show `[OK] Ukrainian TTS model loaded!` and `[OK] Russian TTS model loaded!` when ready
- Check the browser console for errors on the `/tts` endpoint

**No English sound on flashcards?**
- English TTS uses the browser's Web Speech API - make sure your browser supports it
- Check that your OS has English voice packs installed

**Python dependency issues?**
```bash
pip install torch
pip install espnet
pip install flask flask-cors
cd tts-repo && pip install -e . && cd ..
```

**Russian model won't download?**
- The Silero model downloads from `https://models.silero.ai/models/tts/ru/v5_ru.pt`
- You can download it manually and place it at `tts-model-ru/v5_ru.pt`

**Ukrainian model won't download?**
- The ESPnet model downloads from GitHub releases of [robinhad/ukrainian-tts](https://github.com/robinhad/ukrainian-tts/releases)
- Check your internet connection and try running `python tts-server.py` again

**Want HTTPS? (optional, needed for Web Speech API on some networks)**
```bash
mkdir .cert
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout .cert/key.pem -out .cert/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
The dev server will automatically use HTTPS when these cert files exist, and fall back to HTTP otherwise.

**Port already in use?**
- Close other apps using ports 5173 or 3002
- Or edit the port in `vite.config.js` / `tts-server.py`
