## What You Need to Install First

You need two free programs before the game will work. Think of these like installing a media player before you can watch a video - they run behind the scenes.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is what runs the game in your browser.

1. Go to **https://nodejs.org/**
2. Click the big green button that says **"LTS"** (this is the recommended/stable version)
3. A file will download (something like `node-v22.x.x.msi`)
4. **Double-click** the downloaded file to open the installer
5. Click **"Next"** through all the screens - the default settings are fine
6. Click **"Install"**, then **"Finish"** when it's done

That's it for Node.js!

### Step 2: Install Python

Python is needed for the pronunciation feature (hearing words spoken out loud). The game still works without it, but you won't hear Ukrainian or Russian pronunciation.

1. Go to **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. Click the big yellow button that says **"Download Python 3.x.x"**
3. A file will download (something like `python-3.x.x.exe`)
4. **Double-click** the downloaded file to open the installer
5. **IMPORTANT: Check the box at the bottom that says "Add Python to PATH"** - this is the most common mistake people make. If you miss this, the game won't be able to find Python later.
6. Click **"Install Now"**
7. Click **"Close"** when it's done

That's it for Python!

## How to Download the Game

### Option A: Download as a ZIP file (easiest)

1. Go to **https://github.com/GryphonEDM/gryphons-ukrainian-russian-learning-app**
2. Click the green **"Code"** button near the top-right
3. Click **"Download ZIP"** from the dropdown menu
4. Once downloaded, find the ZIP file in your Downloads folder
5. **Right-click** the ZIP file and choose **"Extract All..."**
6. Choose where you want to put it (your Desktop is fine) and click **"Extract"**
7. You should now have a folder called something like `gryphons-ukrainian-russian-learning-app-main`

### Option B: Using Git (if you already have Git installed)

If you don't know what Git is, just use Option A above.

1. Open **Command Prompt** (press the Windows key, type `cmd`, and hit Enter)
2. Type the following and press Enter:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GryphonEDM/gryphons-ukrainian-russian-learning-app.git
   ```
3. The folder will appear in your user directory

## How to Start the Game

### On Windows (easiest method)

1. Open the game folder you downloaded
2. Find the file called **`start.bat`** - it might just show as **`start`** with a gear icon
3. **Double-click** `start.bat`
4. A black command window will appear - this is normal! It's setting everything up.
   - The first time you run it, it will install some things automatically. This can take a few minutes. Be patient!
   - You might see a Windows security popup asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes?" - click **"Yes"**
5. When it's done, you'll see a message saying "Application Started Successfully!"
6. Two extra black windows will open - **don't close them!** They need to stay open while you use the game.
7. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) and go to: **http://localhost:5173**
8. The game should appear! You're ready to play.

### When you're done playing

Close the two black command windows that were opened by `start.bat`. That shuts everything down cleanly.

### Next time you want to play

Just double-click `start.bat` again. It will be much faster the second time since everything is already installed.

## Troubleshooting (Common Problems)

### "Node.js is not installed" error when running start.bat

This means the installer from Step 1 didn't work correctly. Try:
1. **Restart your computer** after installing Node.js (this helps Windows find the new program)
2. Try running `start.bat` again

### "Python is not installed" error when running start.bat

This usually means you forgot to check **"Add Python to PATH"** in Step 2. To fix it:
1. Go to your Downloads folder and double-click the Python installer again
2. Click **"Modify"**
3. Click **"Next"**
4. Make sure **"Add Python to environment variables"** is checked
5. Click **"Install"**
6. **Restart your computer**
7. Try running `start.bat` again

### The game loads but I can't hear Ukrainian/Russian pronunciation

- This is usually fine on first run! The pronunciation models are large files (~500 MB total) that download automatically the first time. Check the black command window for download progress.
- If it still doesn't work after downloading, close everything and run `start.bat` again.
- Note: English pronunciation works without any extra setup.

### The page says "This site can't be reached" in my browser

- Make sure the black command windows are still open (don't close them)
- Wait about 30 seconds and refresh the page
- Make sure you typed the address correctly: **http://localhost:5173**

### Windows Defender / antivirus blocks something

Some antivirus programs get nervous about new programs. The game is safe and open-source. If your antivirus blocks it:
1. Check the antivirus notification for an "Allow" or "Trust" option
2. Add the game folder to your antivirus exceptions list

### Everything is installed but nothing seems to happen when I double-click start.bat

- Right-click `start.bat` and choose **"Run as administrator"**
- If a window flashes and disappears immediately, there may be an error. Right-click `start.bat`, choose **"Edit"**, and add the word `pause` on its own line at the very end of the file. Save it and double-click again - now the window will stay open so you can read any error messages.

## Setting Up Your Keyboard for Typing

Once the game is running, you'll need to add a Ukrainian or Russian keyboard to your computer so you can type in those languages. The game has a built-in **Keyboard Setup Guide** - look for it on the main screen.

The quick version for Windows:
1. Open **Settings** (press Windows key + I)
2. Go to **Time & Language** > **Language & Region**
3. Click **"Add a language"**
4. Search for **"Ukrainian"** or **"Russian"** and add it
5. Now you can switch between keyboards by pressing **Win + Space**
